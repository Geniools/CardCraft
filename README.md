# Card Craft

## Introduction
CardCraft is a card battle game for 2 people, where the players use a complex strategies to fight between each other via
their card decks.

Before the battle begins, players construct their decks from a vast array of cards. Deck building is a crucial aspect of CardCraft, as players must carefully develop their decks to go forward with their chosen strategy and adapt to their opponent's tactics.

Each player has a set number of health points, representing their overall vitality in the game.
The primary objective is to deplete your opponent's health points to zero before they can do the same to you.

The game progresses through a series of rounds, with each round consisting of players taking turns to play cards from their hands and deploy troops onto the battlefield.

Battles in CardCraft are resolved through a combination of card abilities (*should have*), attack values, health points and mana points.
Each card possesses specific attributes, such as attack strength, health, mana and special abilities (*should have*), which determine its effectiveness in combat.
